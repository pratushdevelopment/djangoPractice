Creating a full Python Django CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application involves several steps. Below, I'll outline the process and provide a basic example to get you started. For this example, let's assume we're building a simple web application to manage a list of books.

Prerequisites:
1. Python and Django installed on your system. You can install Django using `pip install django`.
2. Basic knowledge of Django's project structure and web development concepts.

Step 1: Create a Django Project and App
Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a Django project
django-admin startproject mycrudproject

# Change to the project directory
cd mycrudproject

# Create a new app within the project
python manage.py startapp books
```

Step 2: Define the Model
In the `books` app directory, create a `models.py` file with the following content:

```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    genre = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

Step 3: Create Database Tables and Superuser
Run the following commands to apply the model and create the necessary database tables:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Step 4: Register the Model in the Admin Panel
In the `books/admin.py` file, add the following code:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Book

admin.site.register(Book)
```

Step 5: Define URLs and Views
In the `books` app directory, create a `urls.py` file with the following content:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.book_list, name='book_list'),
    path('create/', views.book_create, name='book_create'),
    path('update/<int:pk>/', views.book_update, name='book_update'),
    path('delete/<int:pk>/', views.book_delete, name='book_delete'),
]
```

In the same `books` app directory, create a `views.py` file with the following content:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect, get_object_or_404
from .models import Book
from .forms import BookForm

def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'books/book_list.html', {'books': books})

def book_create(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = BookForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('book_list')
    else:
        form = BookForm()
    return render(request, 'books/book_form.html', {'form': form})

def book_update(request, pk):
    book = get_object_or_404(Book, pk=pk)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = BookForm(request.POST, instance=book)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('book_list')
    else:
        form = BookForm(instance=book)
    return render(request, 'books/book_form.html', {'form': form})

def book_delete(request, pk):
    book = get_object_or_404(Book, pk=pk)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        book.delete()
        return redirect('book_list')
    return render(request, 'books/book_confirm_delete.html', {'book': book})
```

Step 6: Create Templates and Forms
In the `books` app directory, create a folder named `templates/books`. Inside this folder, create the following templates:

1. `book_list.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Book List</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Book List</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for book in books %}
        <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }} (Genre: {{ book.genre }})</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <a href="{% url 'book_create' %}">Add New Book</a>
</body>
</html>
```

2. `book_form.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Book Form</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{% if form.instance.pk %}Edit Book{% else %}Add New Book{% endif %}</h1>
    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <input type="submit" value="Save">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

3. `book_confirm_delete.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Delete Book</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Delete Book</h1>
    <p>Are you sure you want to delete "{{ book.title }}"?</p>
    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <input type="submit" value="Delete">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Step 7: Create a Form for the Book Model
In the `books` app directory, create a file named `forms.py` with the following content:

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Book

class BookForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ['title', 'author', 'genre']
```

Step 8: Include the App URLs in the Project
In the `mycrudproject` directory, open the `urls.py` file and include the app's URLs:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('books/', include('books.urls')),
]
```

Step 9: Run the Development Server
Start the development server to see your Django CRUD web application in action:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to log in with your superuser credentials and add some books to the database.

Visit `http://localhost:8000/books/` to see the list of books and manage them using the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.

Remember, this is a basic example to get you started. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to extend and customize the application further.
